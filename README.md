Homework 8:
I am developing a visual graph and analyzing patterns within Washingtonians affected based on industry targets.
The next objective would be to determine out of the industry types that were
affected and out of the industry type which had the most affected by which year?

Once that has been determined, what tool was the most used in that year that 
caused the high surge?

Is there a trending correlation of this specific attack that can traverse through the years?
 Is it consistently the same attack?
